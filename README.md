## **Predicting college basketball winners with machine learning models**

### **Objective**:
#### We are using supervised machine learning to compile historical data of all division 1 college basketball teams spanning 2013 to 2019, and creating a model that may accurately predict how well each team would do in subsequent tournaments. We also intend to depict the potential factors that determine if they made it into the tournament bracket.  

### What is our data source?

“College Basketball Dataset.” Andrew Sundberg, Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset?select=cbb13.csv. Accessed 3/11/2023

We also drew on a source for coordinate data to combine with the previous data. 

Please note that with the above dataset, due to the Covid 19 pandemic, the tournament was cancelled in 2020 due to the lockdown. We are using this as an oportunity that, in the hypothetical situation that the pandemic didn't occur, how might each of the teams performed in the competition. 

The visualizations that we are using the depict our findings is the following: 

- In order to answer this question we are first going to generate a single-layer map of the United States which depicts the approximate coordinate location for the school that each team belongs to.
- We are also going to click-based interractive bar graph 
- Selecting the school will also display a .

### **Data**

The data that we were using came from the College Basketball Dataset by Andrew Sundberg which is available on the Kaggle website. 

One hurdle that our group encountered was that the dataset only contained an abbreviated version of the college's name, and not the official name that could have been looked into on a database for finding the proper coordinates to display on a map. 


In order to answer our question we needed 


#### **Visualizations**:

- 1. United States maps.
  
- 2. Click based bar graph .
  
- 3. Click based linear regression model.

- 4. Random Forest

- 5. 

### Add icons with colors to show HVI levels on top of each county:
- NEW JS library: BeautifyMarker-Leaflet.BeautifyMarkers https://github.com/masajid390/BeautifyMarker/blob/master/README.md


### **Conclusion**
- The choropleth visualization 
- By using the 
- Our visuals would help prospective homeowners to find the areas there is the least risk for natural disaster damage helping them find their prefered choice in home.
- Identify trends of change in the relative risk growth in the counties, to identify a relationships between natural disaster risks and changes in home value.

### **Limitations/Future Possibilities**

Current things that we may want to add. 
previous findings in aggregating the data in machine learning was that the factors in the dataset that showed the greatest predictors on a team's chances of proceeding to the tournament was the following:
1. 

Doing a random forest model that we could try to find the features that are the most important to determine whether a team makes it to the tournament bracket. create a visual based on that. 

For this, we also dropped seed, because that would be what seed if they made the bracket, so this factor does not matter and removed. 

if they're an NA it didn't make the tournament, give a 0
1 or 0 for post season whether they made it or not.


neural detwork may go better with more available data as there were only 2500 rows, shape: 1841, 55

Current accuracy at 91 percent

Considering putting in a confusion matrix in there to look at the amount of false positives/negatives

One hurdle we encountered with this route in aggregation was that with Neural networking it is hard to interpret the causation or the why for how the network was able to score a high accuracy. 

It may be better to do a logistic regression model.
